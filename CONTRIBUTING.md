# Contributing to AfriWage

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to **AfriWage** — open-source, instant USDC payroll for African gig workers. Every contribution, from a typo fix to a new feature, directly helps freelancers across Africa get paid faster and more fairly.

---

## Project Mission

AfriWage exists to eliminate the friction of cross-border payroll for Africa's growing gig economy. We believe financial infrastructure should be open, transparent, and accessible to everyone — not gatekept by legacy banking systems.

- **Node.js 20+** — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

- **Git** with signed commits encouraged
- **Freighter wallet** — [freighter.app](https://freighter.app) (for testing wallet features)
- A basic understanding of [Stellar](https://stellar.org) and [USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc)

## Branch Naming Convention

All feature work must branch from `main`.

```
feat/issue-42-send-payment-form
fix/issue-17-balance-display-bug
docs/issue-5-update-readme
chore/issue-11-upgrade-stellar-sdk
refactor/issue-28-extract-wallet-hook
```

**Format:** `{type}/issue-{number}-{short-description}`

---

## Commit Message Convention

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

```
feat: add payment streaming
fix: resolve balance display bug
docs: update contributing guide
chore: upgrade @stellar/stellar-sdk to v12
refactor: extract freighter hook into lib
test: add unit tests for sendPayment
ci: add biome linting step
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`, `perf`, `revert`

Commit messages are validated by `commitlint` on every commit via Husky.
